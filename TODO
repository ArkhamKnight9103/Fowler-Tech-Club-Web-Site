- Update the music element to be more efficient, I know it is possible...
    I am just working on the look & feel of the website right now... watching
    Iron Man 2, I have excuses
- I'll also get rid of the commented html, but it is reference for now

- added some "load-in animations", these make the website look like it is loading
  in smoother
- I may wanna look into getting some more of NitroGuy's great music for the website
  as I use this as my primary source of music
- I'm getting kinda busy, especially since I am doing other stuff this school year...
  now would be a good time to get some other people's ideas for this site...
  I am just making this into something I like and not something viable in the future,
  I think it would be wise to get other people's insight on this matter
