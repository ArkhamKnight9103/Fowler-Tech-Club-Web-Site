August 15th at 12:30 noon I don't see a cloud above<br>
The sun is shining down, what a pretty day<br>
So sick of this summer heat I cant beat away the haze<br>
the rays are giving way<br>
And spending all of my time having conversations sitting next to you<br>

"Hey but I...don't really like the summertime"<br>
And as you were petting on that cat you said such a daring thing<br>
right from under your breath<br>

Ah, and as that cat had ran away<br>
You tried to chase it in the end<br>
Jumping right out in front of a<br>
traffic light that poured a shade of red bright red<br>

Crashing in and breaking you to bits<br>
That truck a heard a scream a little bit too late<br>
Blood dripping everywhere and choking your smell of hair<br>
I breathe in a gulp of air and just cant take it<br>
Are these lies? The heat is mocking me<br>
"What you see is exactly what you're gonna get!"<br>
And with the blue of sky I hear singing crickets cry and<br>
fall right back into another dark sleep<br>

Sitting up in my bed I could hear ticking clocks the shock<br>
will mock my ever ringing head<br>
I look to see the time<br>

August 14th at 12 something noon I don't see a cloud above<br>
The sun is shining down<br>
And yet I hear a cry of a cricket singing loudly in my head<br>

"Hey but I...I really have to wonder why<br>
Because in the dream I had last night we sat in the<br>
same old park we are sitting at now<br>
"Hey, I think the two of us should leave."<br>
But stepping slightly off the path, their heads turned up towards sky<br>
and were gaping pointing struggling to keep away a scream<br>

Stabbing holes and splitting you in two,<br>
the beam made seam as it fell straight from the sky<br>
Ringing an old wind chime and shaking a passerby then filling the air<br>
until they hit those park trees<br>
Are these lies? The heat is mocking me<br>
"Bet you wish you were asleep, but it's not a dream!"<br>
Vision it blurred away and keeping my thoughts at bay I swear you stood there while keeping such a dark smile<br>




Endlessly I see that over heated haze<br>
And again the laughing will repeat on through the days<br>
You've been dying for the past ten years<br>
We are trapped in cycles and the end is never clear<br>

But a story is a story all the same<br>
And today like any has an ending so to say<br>
Far away and out beyond that scorching summer day<br>

Crashing in and hitting me instead you<br>
I pushed you aside to nearly dodge a truck<br>
Blood dripping everywhere and choking my smell of hair<br>
You breathe in a gulp of air and just cant take it<br>
Are these lies? I haven't heard him say<br>
"What you see is exactly what your gonna get"<br>

Maybe this summer day has finally gone away<br>
But that's all I'll say so this is where it ends now<br>

August 14th and sitting alone on a bed a girl awakes repeating just the same<br>
Muttering again<br>

"Guess I failed again.." as she sat all alone<br>
and held a cat still cradled in her arms<br>
